Beatrixt whoe being with Childe by him, and lolring out oi her windowe
towards the Nunnerye oi our B. Ladies, betwixt the F eastes oi her
Assumption and Nativite, she sawe a snowe white Doue, flyeing lrom
thence to her, and with Closed wings entred into her right sleives: which
reniayned with her seaven dayes tame, before she was delivered ol hers
Childe. And this my Author reporteth from the venie mouth oi the
iorementioned Beatrixe. The Childe borne, was Christned by the neme
oi Tbeodore, which asterwerdes shee, vpon Christe appearing vnto her,
chaunged with Christiana3 being verie young and 'religiously inclyned,
she vowed virginitie at St. Albans Relickes, and lived verteouslie, ro
impatient oi immodest speaches.

This young gentlewoman Ranulph [F lamber ¹] Bishop oi Durham
(a men which swayed all England vnder William Rufus) dishonestlie

Γ affected (i), and sought by sundrie means to deprive her oi her virginitie:

which she Constantlie withstode3 and once when the B. had her at such ¹5
a vantage in a retyred Roume, as she coulde scarslie avoyd him, shee had
no other reiudge but to intreat him, ii he would needs persever in that

³ purpose, to permitt her to barr the doore: which he, sweering her to
ἕ semme, suffred3 soe as shee made en escape, less scrupulous to breeke

her iniorced oathe then to lese her virginitie. The yll minded Bishop an

³ being thus crossd ol his perverse purpose, practised to effect it by an

other means, in Causing one Beilred (a man depending on him) to Marrye
her; whoe prevailed soe ferr with her Parentes and irindes (whom shee
durst not contradict) as shee was betroathed vnto him, bnt woulde in noe
sort consent to manye him, till her Fathers hard vsege oi her, in 25
imploiing her in base offices (which she disdained not to effect), in a sort
iniorced her. Being Maried, when they were readie to goe into Bedd,
shee humblye intreated him to forbesre her, whoe had vowed her
virginitye vnto God; end lor ieare oi his displeasure putt him in mynde
oi that which passed betwixt St Cicilia and St. Valerian: which moved 30
him soe much, as hee discisted and was satisfied as it were ior the
present. But his frindes pressed him soe, as hee gave not over to vrge
her often, and that verie eemestlie, to perlorme the part oi a wile with
him: which shee still prevented (thoughe with great delicultie), wherevpon
her husbande Berfsred prevailed soe sarr with her, as he perswaded her ss
to goe with him to a house oi Cannons, where the Superiour Called the
rest ol the Religious men', whoe did perswade her in the presence ol her
husband and them all there to periorme the Act ol Matrimonie with him
whom shee had Married; lor that Manymonie was good and instituted
